wsg, this is just a place where i will keep my scripts, Test3 is a blox fruits - fruit finder script (Not Working!), Test - Test2 are failed versions of it, will be replaced in the future.
all scripts i put here WILL be open source!
My only current working script is in kx and preview, both are the same things, aka a fruit notifier for blox fruits BUT preview is the beta/early access version of it.

u can message me on discord " R3nderDV. " with the dot there.

do not expect super crazy scripts here, i mean, they are good, but not wildly impressive. 24% is done by chatgpt, 7% scrapped from other open source scripts and the rest by me.
i do all my scripts on mobile, sooo. yeah, rarely on laptop however.

heres the loadstring for the fruit finder one.

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r3nderdever/ScriptRepositoryRDV/refs/heads/main/Test3.luau"))()

for the Test - Test1

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r3nderdever/ScriptRepositoryRDV/refs/heads/main/Test.luau"))()

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r3nderdever/ScriptRepositoryRDV/refs/heads/main/Test2.luau"))()


UPD - Script Kx is a fruit notifier - for blox fruits!
All my 100% working and useful scripts will be posted on...
Rscripts.net
hopefully other places soon.
!!
